nothing much just a really tiny blue dot in the middle of the screen;
i used built in GL functions to compile a string(char array) as a shader allowing me to draw to the screen;
using the GLFW and GLAD libarys with GLM in the works; I couldnt get glew to work but GLAD is lighter and faster anyways.

tbh idk who would read this but whoever you are thanking for looking into my shitty code; one day it will be better i promise <3
